## Description  
The Simple Shell project is a basic implementation of a Unix shell. It provides users with the ability to execute commands, navigate the file system, and run programs in both interactive and non-interactive modes.  

## Features  
- **Interactive Mode:** Displays a prompt, waits for user input, and executes commands.  
- **Non-Interactive Mode:** Executes commands from a script or file without user interaction.  
- **Error Handling:** Proper error messages for unsupported commands or incorrect syntax.  
- **Environment Management:** Handles environment variables and pathways.  
- **Command Execution:**  
  - Displays a prompt and waits for user input.  
  - Executes commands entered by the user, ending with a newline (when the *ENTER* key is pressed).  
  - Re-displays the prompt after each executed command.  
- **Exit Behavior:**  
  - Entering `exit` will terminate the shell and return a status of 0.  
  - Entering `exit [status]` will terminate the shell and return the specified exit status (0â€“255).  
  - Using *Ctrl+D* will terminate the shell (EOF).  
- **Command Line Arguments:** Supports commands with arguments and full file paths.  

## Requirements  
- **System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  
- **Compiler:** GCC with the following options:  
  ```bash  
  -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89  
Code Style: Betty style guidelines
